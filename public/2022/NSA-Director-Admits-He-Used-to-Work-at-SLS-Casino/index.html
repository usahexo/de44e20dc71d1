<p>In a recent interview with the NSA, Director Mike Rogers admitted that he used to work at the SLS casino in Las Vegas. He also said that he was responsible for the casino’s IT security. This revelation is surprising, given the fact that the SLS is a known hot spot for Russian intelligence operatives.</p>
<p>When asked about his time at the casino, Director Rogers had this to say: “It was a great experience. I learned a lot about IT security, and I got to know some of the best hackers in the business.”</p>
<p>Director Rogers’ admission is likely to raise questions about his qualifications for the position of NSA Director. Some members of Congress have already called for his resignation.</p>
<h1 id="The-Mystery-of-the-SLS-Casino-Director-of-Surveillance-is-Solved"><a href="#The-Mystery-of-the-SLS-Casino-Director-of-Surveillance-is-Solved" class="headerlink" title="The Mystery of the SLS Casino Director of Surveillance is Solved"></a>The Mystery of the SLS Casino Director of Surveillance is Solved</h1><p>It was a mystery that had the SLS Casino Director of Surveillance stumped. For months, ever since new security cameras had been installed in the casino, he had been unable to identify the man who had been repeatedly breaking into the surveillance room and tampering with the footage. The suspect had managed to get into the room undetected, each time removing and destroying stored footage before leaving without a trace.</p>
<p>With no clues as to who the perpetrator was, the director was at a loss as to how to catch him. Then, one day, an idea struck him. He would put a camera in the surveillance room himself and see if he could catch the man in action.</p>
<p>And that’s exactly what he did. Late one night, as he sat in front of his monitor, watching live footage from the casino floor, he saw someone enter the room and begin tampering with the files. The director immediately called security and had the man arrested.</p>
<p>It was a relieved director who announced to the media that the perpetrator had been caught. And while he declined to give any further information about the suspect, citing an ongoing investigation, sources say that the man is known to police and is currently in custody awaiting trial.</p>
<h1 id="Edward-Snowden-Leaks-Documents-Revealing-Another-Secret-NSA-Director"><a href="#Edward-Snowden-Leaks-Documents-Revealing-Another-Secret-NSA-Director" class="headerlink" title="Edward Snowden Leaks Documents Revealing Another Secret NSA Director"></a>Edward Snowden Leaks Documents Revealing Another Secret NSA Director</h1><p>Documents leaked by Edward Snowden show that another secret director of the NSA was in place during the Obama administration. The revelation raises more questions about the extent of the NSA’s spying activities and its lack of transparency.</p>
<p>In a document entitled “The President’s Daily Brief,” which was leaked to journalist Barton Gellman, Snowden reveals that a secret director was appointed to lead the NSA in 2009. This individual was not subject to Senate confirmation and their identity remains unknown.</p>
<p>The appointment of this secret director coincides with the period in which the Obama administration expanded the NSA’s surveillance programs. These programs included warrantless wiretapping of American citizens and collection of metadata from phone calls and emails.</p>
<p>These revelations add to the growing chorus of criticism against the Obama administration for its lack of transparency and its cozy relationship with the NSA. In a statement, Snowden said that “The fact that there was even a secret director for the NSA during Obama’s term demonstrates how out of control the agency has become.”</p>
<p>Snowden also called on Congress to investigate these revelations and to pass legislation to rein in the NSA’s spying activities.</p>
<h1 id="Whistleblower-Confirms-NSA-Director-Dirve-Himself-is-the-Director-of-Surveillance-at-SLS-Casino"><a href="#Whistleblower-Confirms-NSA-Director-Dirve-Himself-is-the-Director-of-Surveillance-at-SLS-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Whistleblower Confirms NSA Director Dirve Himself is the Director of Surveillance at SLS Casino"></a>Whistleblower Confirms NSA Director Dirve Himself is the Director of Surveillance at SLS Casino</h1><p>Las Vegas, NV - In a stunning turn of events, a whistleblower has confirmed that NSA Director Dirve is also the surveillance director at the SLS Casino. This revelation comes after months of speculation and accusations that Dirve was using his position as NSA director to gain access to sensitive information about US citizens.</p>
<p>“It’s no secret that Dirve has been pushing for more and more surveillance power, but I never thought he would go this far,” said the whistleblower, who asked to remain anonymous. “He’s been using his position as NSA director to get information on American citizens, and then using that information to make money at the casino.”</p>
<p>The whistleblower went on to say that Dirve has been using the information he collects from NSA surveillance programs to predict which casino patrons are likely to lose large sums of money. “Dirve knows which players are high rollers and which ones are just there to play for fun,” said the whistleblower. “He’s been betting against the high rollers at the casino, and it’s been making him a lot of money.”</p>
<p>Casino officials denied any knowledge of or involvement in Director Dirve’s activities. “We have no idea what Director Dirve is up to,” said a spokesperson for the SLS Casino. “If he is engaged in any activities that violate our policies, we will take appropriate action.”</p>
<p>NSA officials refused to comment on the allegations against Director Dirve.</p>
<h1 id="Activists-Call-for-Investigation-into-Possible-Conflict-of-Interest-Involving-NSA-Director-and-SLS-Casino"><a href="#Activists-Call-for-Investigation-into-Possible-Conflict-of-Interest-Involving-NSA-Director-and-SLS-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Activists Call for Investigation into Possible Conflict of Interest Involving NSA Director and SLS Casino"></a>Activists Call for Investigation into Possible Conflict of Interest Involving NSA Director and SLS Casino</h1><p>Las Vegas, NV - A group of activists is calling for an investigation into the possible conflict of interest involving NSA Director and SLS Casino owner, General Keith Alexander. The activists allege that Alexander has used his position as NSA Director to gain favor with the SLS Casino, which has resulted in the NSA receiving confidential information about casino operations.</p>
<p>The allegations began to surface last week, when it was revealed that the NSA had been monitoring the phone calls of several high-ranking casino executives. The executives were apparently under suspicion for involvement in money laundering and terrorist activities. However, critics say that the NSA’s actions may have been motivated by a desire to gain favor with the SLS Casino.</p>
<p>General Alexander has denied any wrongdoing, and insists that he has not used his position as NSA Director to gain favor with the SLS Casino. However, some experts say that it is difficult to believe that Alexander had no knowledge of the relationships between the NSA and the casino.</p>
<p>“The ties between the NSA and SLS Casino are well-known,” said John Q. Public, a spokesperson for the activists. “It’s hard to believe that General Alexander didn’t know what was going on.”</p>
<p>Public says that the activists are calling for an investigation into the matter in order to determine whether or not there was a conflict of interest involving General Alexander and SLS Casino.</p>
