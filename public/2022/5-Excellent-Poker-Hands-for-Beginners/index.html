The first thing you need to know is which hands are the best to play. Here are five excellent poker hands for beginners:</p>
<ol>
<li>Royal flush</li>
</ol>
<p>A royal flush is the best possible hand in poker and consists of five cards of the same suit in sequence, such as 10-J-Q-K-A. This hand is so rare that most beginners will never see it, but it’s worth knowing about just in case.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Straight flush</li>
</ol>
<p>A straight flush is five consecutive cards of the same suit, such as 8-9-10-J-Q. This is a very powerful hand and beats all other regular hands except a royal flush.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Four of a kind</li>
</ol>
<p>Four of a kind consist of four cards of the same rank, such as four queens or four sixes. This hand is very strong and usually beats a full house.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Full house</li>
</ol>
<p>A full house consists of three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank, such as three kings and two sevens. This hand is usually good enough to win most no limit Texas Hold’em games.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Flush</li>
</ol>
<p>A flush is five cards of the same suit, not all in sequence, such as J-9-6-4-2 rainbow). This hand can be played any time you have at least four cards of the same suit (not including wildcards).</p>
<h1 id="How-Many-Poker-Hands-are-There"><a href="#How-Many-Poker-Hands-are-There" class="headerlink" title="How Many Poker Hands are There?"></a>How Many Poker Hands are There?</h1><p>There are a total of 2,598,960 different poker hands that can be made. This includes both the four-of-a-kind and the full house hands. If you want to know how to make every possible poker hand, we have a list for that too. Just be prepared to spend some time learning the game!</p>
<p>There are 10 different kinds of poker hands (see below), and each one is ranked according to its probability of being won. The Royal Flush is the best hand you can have, while Two Pair is at the bottom of the list.</p>
<p>Here are the 10 types of poker hands, in order from best to worst:</p>
<ol>
<li>Royal Flush</li>
<li>Straight Flush</li>
<li>Four of a Kind</li>
<li>Full House </li>
<li>Flush</li>
<li>Straight</li>
<li>Three of a Kind </li>
<li>Two Pair  </li>
<li>One Pair </li>
<li>High Card</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="The-Odds-of-Getting-a-Royal-Flush-in-Poker"><a href="#The-Odds-of-Getting-a-Royal-Flush-in-Poker" class="headerlink" title="The Odds of Getting a Royal Flush in Poker"></a>The Odds of Getting a Royal Flush in Poker</h1><p>There is only a 1 in 649,740 chance of getting a royal flush in poker. This means that the odds of seeing one are about 1 in 2,220.</p>
<p>The royal flush is the highest possible hand in poker and consists of 10, J, Q, K, and A all of the same suit. This hand is so rare that some casinos reportedly offer a million-dollar prize to any player who can achieve it.</p>
<p>While the odds of getting a royal flush may seem daunting, there are still plenty of ways to win at poker. In fact, even if you don’t get a royal flush, you can still win the game by beating your opponents’ hands.</p>
<h1 id="What-is-the-Best-Poker-Hand"><a href="#What-is-the-Best-Poker-Hand" class="headerlink" title="What is the Best Poker Hand?"></a>What is the Best Poker Hand?</h1><p>There are 10 types of poker hands, from the weakest (pair of 2s) to the strongest (royal flush). In this article, we’ll take a look at each hand and discuss which is the best.</p>
<ol>
<li>pair of 2s</li>
</ol>
<p>The weakest hand in poker is a pair of 2s. It has zero chance of winning a showdown against any other hand.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>pair of 3s</li>
</ol>
<p>A pair of 3s is slightly better than a pair of 2s, but it’s still not a strong hand. It has only a 1 in 12 chance of winning a showdown.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>pair of 4s</li>
</ol>
<p>A pair of 4s is marginally better than a pair of 3s, but it’s still not a top-tier hand. It has only a 1 in 24 chance of winning a showdown.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>pair of 5s</li>
</ol>
<p>A pair of 5s is better than a pair of 4s, but it’s still not great. It has only a 1 in 36 chance of winning a showdown.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>pair of 6s</li>
</ol>
<p>A pair of 6s is even better than a pair of 5s, but it’s still not great enough to win most hands. It has only a 1 in 48 chance of winning a showdown.</p>
<h1 id="Which-Poker-Hands-Beat-Which"><a href="#Which-Poker-Hands-Beat-Which" class="headerlink" title="Which Poker Hands Beat Which?"></a>Which Poker Hands Beat Which?</h1><p>The ranking of poker hands is a complex affair that has been studied by mathematicians and statisticians for many years. There are many variations, but the most common consensus is what is known as the “Poker Hand Rankings.”</p>
<p>This system ranks all possible five-card poker hands from best to worst. The highest-ranking hand is the royal flush, which consists of ace, king, queen, jack and ten all of the same suit. A royal flush is an unbeatable hand and will always win against any other combination of cards.</p>
<p>After the royal flush, the next best hand is the straight flush, which is five consecutive cards all of the same suit. Following that are four different types of flushes (all suits), then three of a kind, two pair, one pair and finally high card.</p>
<p>If two players have identical hands, the player with the highest rank wins (for example two aces would beat two kings). In the event that both players have the same rank card (for example two queens), then the suit order is used to break any ties (clubs, diamonds, hearts, spades). If both players still have the same rank and suit, then it’s a draw and no money changes hands.</p>
<p>Now that you know how to rank poker hands, let’s take a look at some scenarios where different combinations would win or lose against each other.</p>
<h1 id="scenario-1-Player-A-has-a-pair-of-jacks-and-player-B-has-two-queens"><a href="#scenario-1-Player-A-has-a-pair-of-jacks-and-player-B-has-two-queens" class="headerlink" title="scenario 1: Player A has a pair of jacks and player B has two queens"></a>scenario 1: Player A has a pair of jacks and player B has two queens</h1><p>  In this scenario, player A would win because they have higher ranked cards (the jacks). If player B had two kings instead of queens, they would win because their cards are higher ranked than player A’s.</p>
