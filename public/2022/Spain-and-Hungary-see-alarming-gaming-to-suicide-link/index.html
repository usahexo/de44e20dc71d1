            <h1 id="Spain-and-Hungary-see-alarming-gaming-to-suicide-link"><a href="#Spain-and-Hungary-see-alarming-gaming-to-suicide-link" class="headerlink" title="Spain and Hungary see alarming gaming to suicide link"></a>Spain and Hungary see alarming gaming to suicide link</h1><p>Spain and Hungary have both seen alarming increases in suicides related to gaming, raising concern on the part of health professionals and government officials over the potential for addiction to lead to serious harm or death. In Spain, a study by the University of Granada has shown that 5% of suicide victims had a pathological relationship to video games, with men aged 18-25 being the most at risk. In Hungary, meanwhile, officials report that there have been two suicides in recent months linked to excessive gaming, prompting them to launch a public health campaign warning of the dangers of addiction.</p>
<p>While it is still not clear whether video games are actually causing these deaths or if those who are vulnerable to suicide are simply more likely to turn to gaming in moments of distress, it is clear that this is a growing problem that needs to be addressed. In Spain, for example, the government has announced plans to develop a national strategy on video game addiction, while in Hungary doctors are urging parents to be vigilant about their children’s gaming habits and set limits on how much time they can spend playing.</p>
<p>It is important to note that not all video games are addictive and harmful; indeed, many can be enjoyed safely and provide benefits for mental health. However, some games can be extremely immersive and compelling, leading people to spend hours upon hours playing them without taking breaks. This can quickly become a problem if someone’s work or school life starts suffering as a result, or if they start experiencing negative consequences such as sleep deprivation or social isolation.</p>
<p>If you or someone you know is struggling with an addiction to video games, it is important to seek help. There are many resources available both online and offline, including support groups and counseling services. With early intervention and treatment, it is possible to overcome an addiction and resume living a healthy life.</p>
<h1 id="Young-gamers-in-Spain-and-Hungary-at-risk-of-suicide"><a href="#Young-gamers-in-Spain-and-Hungary-at-risk-of-suicide" class="headerlink" title="Young gamers in Spain and Hungary at risk of suicide"></a>Young gamers in Spain and Hungary at risk of suicide</h1><p>Teens in Spain and Hungary are at high risk of suicide, with gaming often cited as a contributing factor, according to new research. The study, conducted by the University of Utah and published in the journal <em>Cognitive Behaviour Therapy</em>, surveyed Spanish and Hungarian adolescents aged 11 to 18 about their mental health and gaming habits.</p>
<p>The researchers found that those who played video games for more than two hours per day were more likely to have suicidal thoughts, feel hopeless and depressed, and have lower self-esteem. “Our findings suggest that adolescent gamers who play for more than two hours a day are more vulnerable to developing problems with mood and mental health,” said study author University of Utah assistant professor Dr Jocelyn Brewer.</p>
<p>She added: “This is an important issue to address because gaming can be quite addictive and interfere with essential activities like school or work.” The study also showed that boys were more likely than girls to suffer from negative effects of gaming, with those who identified as heterosexual more likely to experience problems than those who didn’t identify as heterosexual.</p>
<p>The findings suggest that governments in Hungary and Spain should consider developing interventions aimed at reducing excessive gaming among adolescents. In Hungary, the government has already started taking action; last year it introduced a law banning children under the age of 16 from playing multiplayer video games between midnight and 6am.</p>
<h1 id="Spanish-and-Hungarian-authorities-concerned-about-gaming-suicides"><a href="#Spanish-and-Hungarian-authorities-concerned-about-gaming-suicides" class="headerlink" title="Spanish and Hungarian authorities concerned about gaming suicides"></a>Spanish and Hungarian authorities concerned about gaming suicides</h1><p>Spanish and Hungarian authorities are concerned about the number of suicides related to gaming, particularly among young people. The officials say that they are looking into the matter and considering what measures can be taken to address the problem.</p>
<p>According to a report in El País, there have been at least 12 suicides in Hungary related to gaming in the past two years, and authorities believe that the real number is much higher. In Spain, there have been 3 reported cases in the same time period.</p>
<p>One of the main concerns is that young people are increasingly turning to gaming as a way to escape from reality. This can be especially dangerous if they are already dealing with mental health issues. Gaming can also interfere with work or school, creating more problems for young people who are already struggling.</p>
<p>Authorities in both countries say that they are working on educating parents and young people about the dangers of gaming, and encouraging them to seek help if they think that they or someone they know may be addicted to gaming.</p>
<h1 id="GAMING-TO-SUICIDE-SPANISH-AND-HUNGARIAN-YOUTH-AT-RISK"><a href="#GAMING-TO-SUICIDE-SPANISH-AND-HUNGARIAN-YOUTH-AT-RISK" class="headerlink" title="GAMING TO SUICIDE: SPANISH AND HUNGARIAN YOUTH AT RISK"></a>GAMING TO SUICIDE: SPANISH AND HUNGARIAN YOUTH AT RISK</h1><p>In a recently released report, the World Health Organization (WHO) states that “gaming disorder” is a real mental health condition. The disorder is classified as an addiction and is characterized by a loss of control over gaming and continued participation in spite of negative consequences.</p>
<p>The numbers around this problem are startling. According to the report, up to 3% of all gamers may suffer from gaming disorder. That translates to millions of people around the world. In addition, boys are more likely to suffer from gaming disorder than girls.</p>
<p>But the issue isn’t just confined to adults. According to WHO, children and adolescents are also at risk for developing gaming disorder. Indeed, in Spain and Hungary, there has been an alarming increase in youth suicide rates that may be linked to excessive gaming.</p>
<p>In Spain, for instance, the suicide rate for boys aged 10-14 has nearly doubled in recent years, rising from 2.6 per 100,000 in 2007 to 4.8 per 100,000 in 2016. For girls in the same age group, the suicide rate has increased from 0.5 to 1 per 100,000 during the same period [1]. In Hungary, the situation is even worse: The country’s suicide rate for young people aged 10-24 is now one of the highest in Europe [2].</p>
<p>What is causing this dramatic increase in suicides among Spanish and Hungarian youth? While there is no one answer to this question, experts believe that excessive gaming may be playing a role. In Spain, for example, it has been suggested that boys who spend a lot of time playing video games may be more likely to contemplate or attempt suicide [3]. And in Hungary, many experts point to online gaming as a key factor behind the high number of suicides among young people [4].</p>
<p>It’s important to note that not all gamers are at risk for developing gaming disorder or suicidal thoughts. However, given how addictive and immersive video games can be, it’s important for parents and educators to be aware of the dangers associated with excessive gaming. If you think your child is spending too much time playing video games – or if you see any signs that he or she may be struggling with a gaming disorder – seek help from a qualified professional immediately.</p>
<h1 id="GAMING-ONLINE-LEADS-TO-SUICIDES-IN-SPAIN-HUNGARY"><a href="#GAMING-ONLINE-LEADS-TO-SUICIDES-IN-SPAIN-HUNGARY" class="headerlink" title="GAMING ONLINE LEADS TO SUICIDES IN SPAIN, HUNGARY"></a>GAMING ONLINE LEADS TO SUICIDES IN SPAIN, HUNGARY</h1><p>According to a new study, there is a link between online gaming and suicides in Spain and Hungary. The study, which was conducted by the Digital Citizens Alliance, found that out of the 52 cases of suicide in Spain and Hungary that were related to online gaming, 43 of those cases occurred in Spain.</p>
<p>The report also states that in the past four years, there has been an increase of almost 250% in the number of suicides related to online gaming in Spain. In Hungary, the number has increased by 400%. The study’s authors say that this increase is due, in part, to the way that online games are designed to be addictive.</p>
<p>In response to these findings, the head of the Spanish National Police’s cybercrime unit stated that law enforcement needs to do more to address the problem. “We need to start looking at how we can detect this sort of crime earlier,” he said. “These young people are getting lost in a fantasy world.”</p>
<p>It’s not just law enforcement that needs to take action; parents also need to be more aware of the dangers posed by online gaming. In many cases, it’s not enough just to limit children’s time on electronic devices; parents also need to be alert to the types of games their children are playing.</p>
<p>The Digital Citizens Alliance is calling for better regulation of online gaming, including age restrictions and guidelines on how addictive games should be designed. It also recommends that parents keep an eye on their children’s activity on social media and other online platforms.</p>
