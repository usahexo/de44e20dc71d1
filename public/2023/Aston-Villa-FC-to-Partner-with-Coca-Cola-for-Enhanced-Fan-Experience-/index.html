<p>Tim Sherwood, Aston Villa Manager, said: “We are delighted to have Coca-Cola as our Official Soft Drinks Partner. They are a globally recognised brand with a rich heritage in sport, and we look forward to working with them to create an enhanced experience for our fans.”</p>

The collaboration will see EA SPORTS create digital and physical experiences for fans of the Premier League club, as well as use Villa’s stars in marketing materials.</p>
<p>The partnership will kicked off at the Barclays Asia Trophy, where Aston Villa will take on reps from Leicester City and Liverpool. For the event, EA SPORTS has developed a new “Match Day” feature for its FIFA Mobile app. This will allow fans to get closer to the action by choosing players for their fantasy team and competing against friends in real-time matches.</p>
