            <h1 id="Newfound-Popularity-for-DFS-as-Betting-on-Sports-Becomes-Legal"><a href="#Newfound-Popularity-for-DFS-as-Betting-on-Sports-Becomes-Legal" class="headerlink" title="Newfound Popularity for DFS as Betting on Sports Becomes Legal"></a>Newfound Popularity for DFS as Betting on Sports Becomes Legal</h1><p>For years, Daily Fantasy Sports (DFS) operators have enjoyed a certain amount of popularity in the United States as they were one of the few legal ways to bet on sports. However, with the recent decision by the US Supreme Court to overturn the federal ban on sports betting, that popularity is starting to skyrocket.</p>
<p>In states where sports betting is now legal, such as New Jersey, Delaware, and West Virginia, DFS operators are seeing a surge in interest and activity. Operators like DraftKings and FanDuel are reporting that signups and deposits are up significantly, and that overall engagement with their platforms is also on the rise.</p>
<p>This is not surprising, as DFS offers a way for bettors to get more engaged with games and players than simply wagering on the outcome. In DFS contests, participants select teams of players and attempt to score the most points possible within a set budget. This allows for a much more interactive experience than simply betting on who will win or lose.</p>
<p>DFS has also proven to be quite lucrative for those who are skilled at it. In 2017, DraftKings’ CEO Jason Robins was named one of the world’s richest people under 40 after he became a majority shareholder in DraftKings. Robins’ net worth is estimated at $1.5 billion.</p>
<p>So far, only a handful of states have legalized sports betting, but that number is expected to grow in coming years. As more states come on board, DFS operators are poised to see even more growth in their user base and profitability.</p>
<h1 id="Increased-Traffic-Leads-to-Higher-Commission-Fees-for-DFS-Sites"><a href="#Increased-Traffic-Leads-to-Higher-Commission-Fees-for-DFS-Sites" class="headerlink" title="Increased Traffic Leads to Higher Commission Fees for DFS Sites"></a>Increased Traffic Leads to Higher Commission Fees for DFS Sites</h1><p>The popularity of daily fantasy sports (DFS) continues to grow, and with that popularity come higher earnings for the DFS sites. A recent study by Eilers Research found that in March 2016, DFS site revenue was up 171 percent from March 2015. In addition, total entry fees rose 155 percent to $227 million.</p>
<p>The growth of the DFS industry is due, in part, to the increased attention it has been getting from media outlets. This increased exposure has led to more players entering contests and spending more on fees.</p>
<p>Another reason for the growth of DFS is its ability to appeal to a variety of people. There are different types of contests available that appeal to everyone from casual players who are looking for a fun diversion to those who take the games seriously and want to compete for large prize pools.</p>
<p>The rise in revenue for DFS sites is good news for players as well. This means that site operators are able to offer larger guaranteed prize pools and higher payouts. In addition, many operators now offer freerolls and lower-entry contests, making it easier for players to get involved in DFS games.</p>
<p>DFS is still a relatively new industry, and its growth is sure to continue in the years ahead. As more people become aware of this fun and exciting way to wager on sporting events, the popularity of DFS will only increase. This means that site operators will continue to see their profits grow, ensuring that players will be able to enjoy even better gaming experiences in the future.</p>
<h1 id="Bettors-Shift-Attention-from-Season-Long-Fantasy-Leagues-to-Daily-Contests"><a href="#Bettors-Shift-Attention-from-Season-Long-Fantasy-Leagues-to-Daily-Contests" class="headerlink" title="Bettors Shift Attention from Season-Long Fantasy Leagues to Daily Contests"></a>Bettors Shift Attention from Season-Long Fantasy Leagues to Daily Contests</h1><p>Betting on sports has evolved over the years, with bettors now preferring to participate in daily contests as opposed to season-long fantasy leagues. The reasons for this shift are numerous, but three main drivers can be identified:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Increased excitement and drama: The best thing about daily contests is that there is always something new on the line. Every day, you have a chance to win big or lose everything. This creates a sense of excitement and drama that is lacking in season-long leagues, where the outcomes of many matchups are already known by the time the final games are played.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Easier to follow: In a season-long league, you have to keep track of dozens of players and matchups over an extended period of time. This can be difficult for some people, especially if they are not avid sports fans. Daily contests are much easier to follow, as you only need to focus on a small number of players and matchups each day.</p>
</li>
<li><p>More opportunities to win money: In a typical season-long league, the prize pool is often capped at around $1,000 or $2,000. This limits how much money can be won by participants. However, daily contests tend to have much higher prize pools, making it possible for players to win thousands or even tens of thousands of dollars.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The rise in popularity of daily contests can be seen in the growing number of websites and apps offering these types of bets. One such site is DraftKings, which has seen its user base explode in recent years. In fact, according to Forbes Magazine, DraftKings was responsible for “more than 60% of all legal online sports betting in the United States” in 2016.</p>
<p>So why are daily contests gaining in popularity? The answer is simple – they offer bettors more excitement and opportunities to win money than traditional season-long leagues do. If you are looking for a more exciting way to bet on sports, then I recommend giving daily contests a try!</p>
<h1 id="NFL-and-NBA-Players-Benefit-the-Most-from-Legalized-Sports-Betting"><a href="#NFL-and-NBA-Players-Benefit-the-Most-from-Legalized-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="NFL and NBA Players Benefit the Most from Legalized Sports Betting"></a>NFL and NBA Players Benefit the Most from Legalized Sports Betting</h1><p>The National Football League (NFL) and National Basketball Association (NBA) have long been the two most popular sports in the United States. In recent years, their popularity has only grown, with both leagues boasting massive television and online viewership numbers. As their popularity has grown, so too has the amount of money wagered on their games.</p>
<p>In a 2014 report, the American Gaming Association estimated that $US 95.5 billion was wagered on NFL and NBA games, both legally and illegally. That same report found that only 2.7% of that amount, or $2.6 billion, was wagered legally through Nevada sports books.</p>
<p>The NFL and NBA have been trying to get a piece of that legal action for years now, and they may finally be getting what they want. In May of 2018, the Supreme Court overturned a federal law that had outlawed sports betting outside of Nevada. Since then, several states have moved to legalize sports betting, including New Jersey, where the NFL and NBA are based.</p>
<p>Legalized sports betting is a huge win for the NFL and NBA for a few reasons. First, it will bring in more revenue for the leagues through fees charged to casinos and other gambling operators. Additionally, it will help to legitimize the leagues in the eyes of many bettors who have previously viewed them as being “fixed” or otherwise biased towards certain teams or players.</p>
<p>Finally, legalized sports betting will likely lead to an increase in viewership numbers as fans tune in to watch not just the game itself, but also the various betting odds and outcomes thereof. This increased viewership will result in increased ad revenue for both leagues, as well as increased ticket sales and other sources of revenue.</p>
<p>Overall, it’s clear that the NFL and NBA stand to make a lot of money from legalized sports betting. While there are some potential downsides to be aware of (such as an increased risk of game-fixing), the positives clearly outweigh them at this point. As such, it’s no surprise that both leagues are working hard to get as much of the legalization pie as possible.</p>
<h1 id="DFS-Industry-Braces-for-Changes-as-Legislators-Grapple-with-Sports-Betting"><a href="#DFS-Industry-Braces-for-Changes-as-Legislators-Grapple-with-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="DFS Industry Braces for Changes as Legislators Grapple with Sports Betting"></a>DFS Industry Braces for Changes as Legislators Grapple with Sports Betting</h1><p>DFS (daily fantasy sports) operators are hopeful that a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision will set the stage for re-regulation of the industry, but they are also preparing for a range of possible outcomes in the months ahead.</p>
<p>In May, the Supreme Court overturned a 26-year-old federal ban on sports betting, opening the door for states to legalize and regulate the activity. DFS operators are urging legislatures to include them in any new regulatory schemes, arguing that they are better positioned than casinos or bookmakers to offer safe and legal sports betting.</p>
<p>At the same time, some lawmakers are pushing for a more restrictive approach that would impose significant regulatory burdens on DFS operators. These legislators argue that DFS is nothing more than online gambling, and should be subject to the same prohibitions and restrictions as other forms of gambling.</p>
<p>The outcome of this debate is still unclear, but DFS operators are preparing for a wide range of possible outcomes. Some may choose to suspend operations in states where regulations are too onerous, while others may decide to fight for their place in the newly-opened market.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court decision is likely to have a significant impact on the DFS industry, and it will be interesting to see how things play out in the months ahead.</p>
