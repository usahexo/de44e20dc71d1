#  Who owns the Turning Stone Casino in Senegal?

The casino is a controversial topic in Senegal, given its close proximity to the capital city of Dakar. The government has not released information about who owns the casino, but there are several theories. Some believe that the casino is owned by a Chinese company, while others think that it is owned by a Russian businessman. Still others believe that it is owned by a Lebanese family.

No matter who owns the casino, there is no doubt that it is a lucrative business. The casino has been accused of being a major contributor to money laundering and terrorism financing in Senegal. It is also believed to be responsible for exacerbating poverty and unemployment in the country.

The Senegalese government has promised to investigate the ownership of the casino, but so far nothing has been released to the public. There are calls for the government to nationalize the casino, but it is unclear if this will happen. In the meantime, the casino remains open for business and continues to generate controversy in Senegal.

#  How much revenue does the casino generate for the owner?

It is important to note that not everyone can own a casino. There are certain requirements that you must meet in order to be approved by the government. In most cases, you need to be licensed and this can be quite difficult to obtain. However, if you are able to get a license, then you will be able to open up your own casino and start making money.
