# Major US sports leagues continue opposition to online gambling

The major US sports leagues – the National Football League (NFL), National Basketball Association (NBA), National Hockey League (NHL), and Major League Baseball (MLB) – continue to oppose any expansion of legalized gambling, including online gambling.

In a joint statement issued in October 2017, the leagues reiterated their opposition to any form of legalized gambling, arguing that it would "dramatically" increase the risk of game-fixing and other corrupt practices.

Online gambling is currently legal in only a few states, including Nevada and New Jersey. In recent years, there has been growing momentum among lawmakers to expand online gambling to other states.

The NFL, NBA, NHL, and MLB argue that this would create a significant risk for players, team owners, referees, and other league employees who could be compromised by illegal gambling activities. They also expressed concern that children and other inexperienced gamblers could be taken advantage of through online gambling.

While the leagues have not taken a formal position on fantasy sports betting – which is currently legal in most states – they expressed concern about the potential for fraud and cheating in that industry as well.

The NFL, NBA, NHL, and MLB all have considerable lobbying power in Washington DC, and they are not afraid to use it. In recent years they have successfully lobbied Congress to block any effort to legalize or expand online gambling.

# Online gambling still illegal in most of US

In spite of the federal government’s efforts to legalize online gambling in the United States, the majority of the states still consider it as an illegal act.

Las Vegas Sands CEO Sheldon Adelson has been one of the driving forces behind this campaign and has even contributed millions of dollars to lobby firms in order to make this happen. The casino magnate believes that online gambling will cannibalize land-based casinos and believes that it should only be allowed in states that already have gambling operations.

Early last year, a bill was introduced in the House of Representatives that aimed to legalize online gambling but it never made it out of committee. There are a number of reasons for this, with many legislators expressing concerns over consumer protection and whether or not underage gambling would be rampant.

There are a number of other bills that have been introduced over the years but none have gained traction. This is likely due to the strong opposition from Adelson and his financial contributions to politicians.

Even though online gambling is illegal in most states, there are still a number of people who engage in it. This is usually done through offshore operators who aren’t bound by US law. These sites often don’t have the same safety measures in place as those offered by licensed and regulated operators within the US.

This lack of regulation has led to a number of scams where players have lost money unexpectedly. In some cases, players have even had their personal information stolen by cybercriminals operating on these unlicensed sites.

# Illegal online gambling crackdown continues in Pennsylvania

As part of a continuing crackdown on illegal online gambling, the Pennsylvania Attorney General’s Office announced charges against three more people this week.

According to officials, the individuals were charged with promoting and operating an illegal gambling business.

The charges are the latest in a series of actions taken by the state as it tries to crack down on illegal gambling operations. In October, the Attorney General’s Office filed criminal charges against 13 people involved in an alleged illegal online gambling ring.

Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro said that the latest round of charges sends a clear message that his office will not tolerate illegal gambling in the state.

“This ongoing crackdown is focused on protecting Pennsylvanians from organized crime and other nefarious actors who seek to profit at our expense,” Shapiro said in a statement. “Illegal gambling ruins lives and undermines our economy, and we are committed to rooting it out.”

In addition to the criminal charges, officials also seized nearly $1 million in assets related to the alleged gambling ring.

#  Nevada and Delaware extend online gambling partnership

In a move that is sure to further their online gambling partnerships, Nevada and Delaware today announced they have extended their current arrangement.

The two states have been sharing player pools since March of this year, and the new extension will see that continue until the end of 2019.

Why the Extension?

The extension comes as no real surprise, as both states have seen positive results from the cooperation.

Delaware in particular has seen a significant increase in revenue from online gambling since teaming up with Nevada. The state’s Division of Gaming reports that gross gaming revenue (GGR) from online gambling increased by more than $1 million between March and September of this year.

That’s a jump of about 25 percent, and it’s put Delaware on track to exceed its projected online gambling revenue for 2018. In total, the state is expected to generate around $7 million from internet gambling this year – a far cry from the paltry $363,000 it brought in during 2014.

Nevada has also benefited from the partnership, albeit to a lesser extent. In August, for example, the state reported that its share of online poker revenue had increased by about 15 percent since the two states began sharing player pools. That may not seem like much, but it does add up over time.

A Win-Win Situation?

So far, it appears that both states are getting something out of the deal – which is likely why they’ve decided to keep it going for another three years. But what about players? Do they stand to gain anything by being able to access games at both Nevada and Delaware sites?

The answer is yes. Not only do players get to enjoy a larger selection of games, but they can also take advantage of some nice bonuses too. For example, at present PartyPoker offers players who sign up via its links a 100 percent match bonus worth up to $500. That’s in addition to any other bonuses you may be eligible for as part of your welcome package. So if you’re looking for somewhere to play online poker in the US, be sure to check out PartyPoker – and Nevada and Delaware sites too!

#  Is online gambling finally legal in the United States?

After years of speculation and negotiation, online gambling may finally be legalized in the United States. On September 11, 2018, a bill was introduced in the House of Representatives that would legalize most forms of online gambling. The move has been praised by the casino industry, which has long lobbied for such a change.

Opponents of online gambling argue that it is especially dangerous for young people and can lead to addiction. They also claim that it can be used to launder money and finance terrorism. Proponents of legalization argue that these dangers already exist with traditional forms of gambling, such as casinos and racetracks, and that regulating online gambling will help to mitigate these risks.

So far, there is no indication whether or not the bill will pass. If it does, it will likely face opposition in the Senate. Nevertheless, this latest development shows that there is growing momentum behind legalization of online gambling in the United States.
