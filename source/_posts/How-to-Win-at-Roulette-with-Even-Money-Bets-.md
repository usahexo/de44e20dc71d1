#  How to Win at Roulette with Even Money Bets 

There are a few things to remember when playing roulette in order to win with even money bets:

- First and foremost, always bet on black or red. This will give you a 50/50 chance of winning your bet.

- Secondly, never bet on anything other than a straight up number. This will give you the best odds of winning your bet.

- Finally, make sure to place your bets early in the game so that the casino doesn’t have time to change the odds in their favour.

#  How to win every time when playing roulette 

There are many people that enjoy playing roulette, but don’t know how to win every time. Here we will share some tips on how to do just that!

The first thing you need to do is familiarize yourself with the different types of bets that can be placed. The basic bets are: 
-Straight up bet: this is a bet on a single number and pays out 35 to 1 
-Split bet: this is a bet on 2 adjoining numbers and pays out 17 to 1 
-Street bet: this is a bet on 3 adjoining numbers on one line and pays out 11 to 1 
-Corner bet: this is a bet on 4 numbers that make a square and pays out 8 to 1 
-Six line bet: this is a bet on 6 adjoining numbers and pays out 5 to 1 

Once you understand the different types of bets, you need to choose which ones to place. There are no sure fire ways to win every time, but some bets are better than others. The best bets are the ones that have the lowest odds against you, such as the Straight up, Split and Corner bets. Avoid betting on Street or Six line bets, as these have odds against you of more than 2/1.

Next, you need to choose your lucky number. Many people like to use their birthdate or anniversary as their lucky number, but you can choose whatever number you like. Once you have your lucky number, start by betting small amounts until you feel comfortable increasing your stake. It’s important not to get too carried away when winning and make sure you always leave yourself enough money to continue playing.

Finally, remember to stay calm and coolheaded when playing roulette. Don’t let the excitement of winning get the better of you and make sure you keep track of how much money you’re spending. Roulette can be a lot of fun, but it’s important to remember that it’s still just a game!

#  Secrets to winning big playing Roulette – even money bets!

Roulette is one of the most popular casino games in the world and offers players the chance to win big. However, many players are unaware of the best ways to play the game in order to maximize their chances of winning. In this article, we will reveal some secrets to winning big when playing Roulette.

One of the most important things to remember when playing Roulette is that you should always bet on even money bets whenever possible. This means betting on black or red, odd or even, and 1-18 or 19-36. These bets offer the best chances of winning and also have relatively low odds, making them a good choice for novice players.

Another thing to keep in mind when playing Roulette is to avoid betting on specific numbers. While these bets offer the chance to win big, they also have high odds and are therefore not as favourable as even money bets.

Finally, it is important to be patient when playing Roulette. Don’t try to bet on too many numbers at once – focus on only a few selections and wait for the right opportunity before placing your bet. If you follow these tips, you will be well on your way to winning big when playing Roulette!
