#  Online Poker Legal in These 7 States

Online poker is legal in certain parts of the United States, mainly in the states that have legalized it. Poker players are enjoying the game in these states, as they can do so without any fear of prosecution.

The seven states where online poker is currently legal are Nevada, New Jersey, Delaware, California, Illinois, Pennsylvania and Michigan. These states offer a variety of poker games for their residents, including both cash games and tournaments.

Players in these states can enjoy playing for real money at different online poker sites. They can also compete against players from other states that have legalized online poker. This provides them with a larger player pool and more opportunities to win money.

In addition to the seven states where online poker is legal, there are a few other states that have passed laws authorizing it but have not yet started offering services. These include Colorado, Massachusetts and Minnesota. Online poker is also expected to become legal in New York soon.

The regulating authorities in each state vary when it comes to online poker. Some states have strict regulations while others are more relaxed. Players need to be familiar with the rules of the state in which they are playing before they start playing for real money.

One thing that all of these states have in common is that they allow players to only play against other players located within their state. This prevents out-of-state players from taking advantage of inexperienced or gullible players in smaller markets.

Many people believe that online poker will eventually be legalized nationwide. Once this happens, players will be able to enjoy the game from anywhere in the United States. Until then, players will need to reside in one of the seven states where it is currently legal or one of the other states that are moving towards legalization.

#  Poker Players rejoice: online poker is legal in more states!

Online poker is legal in more states than ever before, as a result of a new ruling from the Department of Justice. This means that poker players can now enjoy the game from the comfort of their own homes in a number of states, including Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Nevada.

The new ruling overturned the 2011 crackdown on online poker, which had made it illegal for companies to offer real-money games to US residents. This resulted in a number of top poker sites shutting down their US operations, including PokerStars and Full Tilt Poker.

Now, with online poker legal in more states, these and other top sites are poised to re-enter the US market. Players can expect a robust offering of games, tournaments, and promotions when they return.

In addition to the three states mentioned above, online poker is also legal in New York, California, Illinois, and a handful of other states. For a full list of legal states, visit https://pokerstars.com/poker/room/legal/.

So far, Nevada has been the most active state in terms of online poker regulation. Earlier this year, the Nevada Gaming Control Board approved regulations that allow for interstate player pooling between Nevada and Delaware. This means that players in both states can now compete against each other in real money games.

It's likely that more states will soon follow suit, as interstate player pooling presents a number of benefits to both players and regulators alike. Players can enjoy bigger prize pools and softer competition; while regulators can ensure that players are protected against fraud and collusion.

For now, it's business as usual at the major US-facing poker sites. However, players should keep an eye on their state's legislative proceedings to see if and when online poker becomes legal in their state.
