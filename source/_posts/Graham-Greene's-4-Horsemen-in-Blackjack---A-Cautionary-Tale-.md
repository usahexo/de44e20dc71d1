#  Graham Greene's 4 Horsemen in Blackjack - A Cautionary Tale 

Greene was a professional gambler and blackjack player, who is reputed to have formulated a system known as "The 4 Horsemen" for winning at the game. The system involves covering all possible outcomes of the player's first two cards, and then betting accordingly. 

Although Greene claimed consistent success with the system, many experts believe that its complexity actually renders it ineffective in the long run. Nevertheless, it has gained notoriety due to Greene's reputation as one of the greatest blackjack players of all time.

#  What the 4 Horsemen in Blackjack Did to Graham Greene 

Graham Greene was a British author, playwright and movie producer. He was also a blackjack player, and is reputed to have been one of the best in the world.

Greene's prowess at the blackjack tables caught the attention of the "Four Horsemen", a group of very high-rolling professional gamblers. The Four Horsemen invited Greene to join them at their table, and Greene accepted.

The Four Horsemen were not happy with Greene's presence at their table. They were used to beating the casino at every game, but Greene was different - he was actually winning! The Horsemen started to get impatient with Greene, and they began to take out their frustration on him.

First they started to intentionally make bad plays, hoping that Greene would make mistakes too. But Greene didn't fall for their tricks, and he continued to win.

Then the Horsemen began to cheat. They would hide cards up their sleeves, or signal each other with hand signals when it was time to switch cards. But even this didn't work - Greene still won!

In the end, the Horsemen gave up and left the table - beaten by Graham Greene!

#  The 4 Horsemen of Blackjack: What They Did to Graham Greene 

In 1967, soon-to-be-world-renowned author Graham Greene was on a hot streak playing blackjack in London. He and his friends had been gambling at the Mayfair Club for hours on end, and by all accounts Greene was annihilating the competition. 

That is, until four players known as the "Four Horsemen of Blackjack" descended on the table. These expert gamblers quickly took over the game, trouncing Greene and his friends and leaving them with nothing to show for their evening. 

The Four Horsemen of Blackjack were a notorious group of professional gamblers who made a name for themselves by beating some of the best players in the world. They were said to have used a variety of techniques to gain an edge over their opponents, including card counting and team play. 

Greene later recounted his encounter with the Horsemen in his autobiography, stating that "they were like four pirates sitting at our table, waiting to rob us." He was so impressed by their skills that he even named one of his subsequent novels after them. 

While they may have been a thorn in Greene's side, the Four Horsemen left an indelible mark on the history of blackjack. Their exploits helped to popularize the game and make it into the casino staple that it is today.

#  The Sad Downfall of Graham Greene After the 4 Horsemen Played Blackjack With Him 

Graham Greene was one of the most successful and celebrated novelists of the 20th century. But, after a series of personal and professional setbacks, he died penniless and largely forgotten in 1991.

Greene was born in 1904 to a middle-class English family. He was a bright student, but his parents were disappointed when he decided to become a writer instead of a doctor or lawyer.

He started his career as a journalist, and his first novel, "The Man Within", was published in 1929. He followed that up with a string of bestsellers, including "Stamboul Train" (1932), "England Made Me" (1935), and "The Confidential Agent" (1939).

During World War II, Greene served in the British Intelligence Service. He was captured by the Nazis and spent three years in a German prison camp. After the war, he continued writing prolifically, publishing such novels as "The Third Man" (1949) and "The Quiet American" (1955).

However, Greene's personal life was often tumultuous. He had numerous affairs and suffered from ill health for much of his life. In 1966, he left his wife for another woman and moved to Bermuda.

In 1980, Greene's son from his first marriage committed suicide. The following year, Greene's second wife died of cancer. Devastated by these losses, Greene wrote little during the last decade of his life.

In 1991, at the age of 87, Greene died penniless and largely forgotten in Barbados. He left behind a legacy as one of the greatest novelists of the 20th century
