#  Hornets bolster their postseason chances with addition of blackjack side bet

The Charlotte Hornets were in need of a spark as they make a late push to secure one of the final playoff spots in the Eastern Conference. On Wednesday night, they found that spark by adding a blackjack side bet to their game.

Adding the side bet seems to have injected new life into the Hornets squad, as they took down the Toronto Raptors 104-96. Kemba Walker led the way for Charlotte with 33 points on 11 for 21 shooting, while Jeremy Lamb came off the bench to score 16 points on 6 for 10 shooting.

Walker was particularly impressive in the fourth quarter, when he scored 16 points to help seal the victory. "I just tried to stay aggressive," Walker said after the game. "I know that's when we need me most, especially down the stretch."

With the win, Charlotte improves to 34-40 on the season, just one game behind Miami for the eighth and final playoff spot in the East. They'll have a chance to inch closer to Miami on Friday night when they host the Heat at Spectrum Center.

"We're still alive," Hornets coach James Borrego said after Wednesday's win. "We still have an opportunity."

Adding a blackjack side bet can be a great way to breathe new life into your basketball team - just ask the Charlotte Hornets.

#  Charlotte Hornets make move to better compete in blackjack side bet

In the competitive world of blackjack, the Charlotte Hornets have decided to make a move to better compete in the blackjack side bet. The Hornets are up against teams like the Golden State Warriors, who recently made a move to add Kevin Durant to their team.

The Hornets first started considering this move at the beginning of the summer when they were contemplating whether or not to sign Nicholas Batum. They eventually decided to sign him to a five-year contract worth $120 million. This gives them some extra firepower to compete in blackjack side bets.

While they may not be able to match up against teams like the Warriors on paper, they now have a lineup that can give them a good chance of winning in blackjack side bets. This new lineup includes Kemba Walker, Nicolas Batum, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, Marvin Williams and Cody Zeller.

With this lineup, the Hornets now have six players who can score more than 10 points per game. This will give them a chance to compete against some of the best teams in blackjack side bets.

While they may not be able to win every game, they now have a lineup that can give them a chance to win most games. This will help them stay competitive in blackjack side bets and should help them improve their record from last season.

The Charlotte Hornets have agreed to a deal with blackjack side bet operation "Side Betting Solutions" to offer the new game amenity at the Spectrum Center for the upcoming NBA season.

The partnership will allow fans in attendance to place bets on various outcomes related to the game, such as which player will score the first point, total points for each team, and so on. Details of the agreement were not released, but sources say that Hornets ownership is "extremely excited" about the new partnership.

As part of the agreement, "Side Betting Solutions" will also have exclusive marketing rights and signage within the arena. In a statement, company CEO Sean O'Brien said that they are "thrilled" to be working with one of the most storied franchises in the NBA.

This is not the first time that sports teams have partnered with gambling operations; both Major League Baseball and the National Football League have long-standing relationships with casinos. However, it is one of the first times that a team has partnered with a side betting operation specifically.

#  More changes for Hornets as they add blackjack side bet

The Charlotte Hornets announced a partnership today with casino game developer Bally Technologies to add blackjack side bets to its in-game betting menu.

The move is seen as another step by the Hornets to improve their in-game experience and attract more fans to their games. The team is coming off a successful 2017/18 season in which they made the playoffs for the first time since 2002.

"Adding blackjack side bets to our in-game betting menu is another way we're putting the fan experience first," said Hornets CEO and president, Fred Whitfield. "We're always looking for ways to improve the fan experience and this partnership with Bally Technologies will do just that."

As part of the partnership, the Hornets will use Bally's CrystalView 360 end-to-end casino gaming solution, which will give fans a chance to place wagers on blackjack games from their seats using mobile devices or tablets.

"Partnering with the Charlotte Hornets provides an opportunity for Bally to showcase our market-leading casino gaming solutions on one of the most exciting teams in the NBA," said Bally Technologies CEO, Richard Munchkin. "Our cutting-edge technology will give fans a unique and immersive experience while also allowing them to bet on live sporting events from the comfort of their seats."

#  Hornets finalize roster with addition of blackjack side bet

The Charlotte Hornets finalized their roster today with the addition of a blackjack side bet. The side bet, which is expected to provide an additional scoring boost for the team, will allow players to place bets on specific situations during games.

The Hornets front office believes that the side bet will help the team win more games this season. "Our players are very excited about the possibility of winning some extra money," said Hornets GM Mitch Kupchak. "This should add another level of excitement to our games."

The side bet will be available to all players, and each player will be able to place bets on different situations. "We wanted to make sure that everyone has a chance to participate in the side bet," said Kupchak. "There are a lot of different ways to win money, so there's something for everyone."

Despite the addition of the side bet, the Hornets remain focused on winning games. "Our goal is still to make the playoffs," said Kupchak. "The side bet is just a bonus."
