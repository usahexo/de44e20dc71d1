#  Get Your Kids In On the Fun With the Barnstormer Bucks Game

If you are looking for a fun game to keep your kids entertained, the Barnstormer Bucks game is perfect. This game is a variation of the classic paper money game, monopoly. The aim of the game is to buy and sell properties in order to make as much money as possible.

The game can be played with two or more players, and it is best for kids aged eight and up. To set up the game, each player needs a $10 bill, a few pens or pencils, and a piece of paper. The first player starts by affixing their name to one end of the paper and folding it in half so that only their name shows. They then put their $10 bill in the middle of the paper.

The other players then take turns rolling the die. If they roll a number that matches one of their pieces on the board, they can move that number of spaces on the board. If they roll doubles, they can either move forward that many spaces or move back two spaces. If they roll three dice and get doubles, they can move six spaces.

If they land on a space with another player’s name on it, they must pay them $1. If they land on a property space, they can buy it from the bank for the listed price or auction it off to the highest bidder. The winner of an auction must have enough money to pay for the property plus an extra $5 for each property they acquire.

If you land on someone else’s property and choose not to buy it, you must pay them rent based on what is listed on the board. If someone lands on your property, you must charge them rent based on what is listed on the board. The first player to run out of money is the loser of the game.

On a recent visit to Walt Disney World, my family had the chance to experience the Barnstormer Bucks game at Magic Kingdom. This new game is a lot of fun for all ages and provides a great way to get some extra spending money while in the park.

The Barnstormer Bucks game can be found near Cinderella’s Castle in Fantasyland. To play, guests purchase cards for $10 each. Then, they use these cards to purchase items from around the park. The items available for purchase vary in price, but most are under $10.

My kids loved being able to buy small treats like popcorn and churros with their playing money. It was also fun for me to be able to get a quick caffeine fix without having to go out of my way.

Overall, we had a great time playing Barnstormer Bucks and would highly recommend it to anyone visiting the Magic Kingdom.
