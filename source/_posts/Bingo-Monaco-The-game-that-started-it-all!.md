### The Origins of Bingo

The game of bingo is believed to have originated in Italy in the 1530s. It was known at the time as 'Lotto' and was a popular game amongst the wealthy classes. A variation of Lotto, called 'Bingo', was brought over to France in the 1700s by soldiers returning from Italy. The game became very popular in France, and soon spread to other parts of Europe.

In the early 1900s, bingo began to be played in America. However, it was not until 1929 that it became really popular, when it was played by people attending a charity event in New York City. From there, bingo quickly spread across the country and became one of the most popular gambling games in America.

It is believed that this name came about because players used to wear hats with little balls inside, so that they could keep track of their numbers.

Bingo didn't really take off until after the Second World War when service men and women brought the game back home with them. It soon became popular in churches and community centres as a way of raising money for good causes.

The first official Bingo hall was opened in Atlanta, USA in 1948. In 1962, the first British Bingo hall opened in Liverpool.

#  Where did the name of Bingo Monaco come from?

The name of the Bingo Monaco game is likely derived from two different sources. The first is the city-state of Monaco, located on the French Riviera. The second may be the film, "Monaco Franze: Der ewige Stenz" (1983), which starred actor and comedian Helmut Berger as the title character. This film was set in the country of Monaco and revolved around a playboy who gambles and womanizes his way through life.
